# Tax Report Generator
This is an automation script written in Python to save myself a few hours every now and then.  
I use it often to sort different columns, remove extra columns, and make calculations in GST tax reports generated by Amazon for sellers.  

## Usage
```
$ sheet <filename>
```
OR  
```
$ sheet --help
```
